                        <p style="font-size:x-large">I'm Jay, Jay Hollow. Today I will begin a very dangerous and extraordinary adventure. I will make alone a freight hop through half Canada. But this freight hop won't be a short trip I have set myself as a goal to tremp from Kingstone to Winnipeg with the help of freight trains. The route is more than 2.000 kilometers long, this will be one of the biggest and longest freight hops anyone has ever made! I will only take light luggage with me on the journey. Something to drink, something to eat, a sleeping bag, waterproof clothing and a scanner around to check the radio between the train driver and the control tower at a yard. The scanner is one of my most important items, I will need it to make sure that nobody saw me after getting on the train. When someone spotted me they often say something like "Trespasser spotted" by radio. In case I hear this broadcast I have to get off the train and run away as fast as I can.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:x-large">My first train should be the CP 75 it would bring me immediately 500km closer to my destination. I try to jump on it a little further behind the yard in order to avoid that an employee sees me and reports me. Fortunately for me, the train hasn't yet picked up as much speed, so I can still jump onto one of the almost 100 freight wagons with ease. Unfortunately I caught a car where there is not much space behind the container. Now I have to get down immediately and find a better car. The train is accelerating very fast and I have to hurry. There is much more room in the next car than in the first. I can stay here.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p style="font-size:x-large">But I forgot to take one important thing with me. I miss my headphones, the clattering and rattling of the train is very loud and unpleasant. That means I have to listen to this noise for more than 15 hours if everything goes well. I have been on this train for 7 hours now, but suddenly the train slows down and stops. I wonder why it stopped maybe I was seen. I switch on my scanner to listen to the train driver's radio. He says "Ready for Crew change?" another voice answers "Yes I am ready". So it was just a simple shift change, the train picks up speed again. Everything was fine.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p style="font-size:x-large">Eight hours later I arrived at my stopover here I have to change trains. Unfortunately the yard was very well lit this increases the chance of being spotted. Adrenaline shoots through my veins my pulse is very high. The train stopped now completely I jump as fast as possible from my car down and run into the nearest bushes. After 10 minutes waiting I realize that I was filmed by a CCTV camera the whole time. I hear security men coming and I fall into panic. I run out of my hiding place and climb over a standing train. Another freight train is leaving a track straight ahead. I see my opportunity and climb onto one of the wagons. But the one I have is a suicide car. A suicide car is a car without a floor I just stand on a small metal beam. I have to hold on all the time not to fall between the big metal hoops of the train. I notice how the power leaves me after 10 minutes and I still donâ€˜t know a way out. I have realized that this adventure is too big for me and this will remain my last adventure. My last thought is now only "let go". And so it was...</p>
